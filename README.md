# CodingAnOpenScienceSong

Hello! This repository stores the code and slides for a two-day Mini Hack that taught participants what NLP is, how to conduct preprocessing and NLP, and how to evaluate the outputs. The workshop is coded in Python, and is pitched for those with minimal coding experience and no NLP experience. There are slides and activities embedded within the Colab, to encourage interaction with the code. 

**Objective**
In the Google Colabs, you can use Python to perform preprocessing for a body of text- in this case, a small corpus of research papers on open and reproducble science. Then, you can use NLP to extract the themes uniting the papers. 

This event was created and organized by the following people (listed in alphebtical order by last name): Maria Balaet, Danielle Kurtin, Yorguin Mantilla Ramos, Violeta Menendez Gonzalez, Constantin Orasan, Roonak Rezvani, Eliana Salas Villa, and Zhaoying Yu
